# Before deploying, make sure you have done the following:
# - created a user `classy` on the host
# - installed SSL certificates for the host
# - created a `.env` file in the same dir as this file and populated appropriately
# - opened port 80 and port 443 (publicly)
#
# A few high-level notes about this config file:
# - At deploy-time, all services have access to the values in the .env file; however, they are only accessible to the
#   running service if the env_file directive is specified. If you only need to pass a subset of the env vars, use the
#   environment directive and list only the var keys you need.
# - As configured, only ports 80 and 443 are seen by the host; all other ports listed (with the expose directive) are
#   only accessible to linked services (i.e. those listed in the depends_on directive). If a service should be publicly
#   accessible, consider listing it in the proxy service instead of opening additional ports on the host.
# - In general, services should be started as non-root users. Here, we launch services as the classy user (configured on
#   the host) using the user directive.
# - Services specified here can be extended (and additional services can be added) by creating additional
#   docker-compose.yml files. See https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#example-use-case.

# NOTE: Do not change the container names. They are used to refer to the service throughout the codebase in http requests.
